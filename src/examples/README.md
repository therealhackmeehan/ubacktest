# Curated Examples for uBacktest.com

Notes:
- examples are seperated into different subcategories involving their root ideologies
- examples are hard coded in typescript but are accessibly as python scripts if you run the toPython.py script and look in the python/ folder
- to test all examples (as a generic syntax check), run test.py after generating python scripts with toPython.py
- all examples are tested and I've done my best to ensure they are logical, plausible, and valid
- all python packages are managed by a venv in this folder called myenv
